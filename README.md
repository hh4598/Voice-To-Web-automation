# Voice-To-Web-automation

It is a small  attemt towards the newly RPA (Robotics Process Automation) Technology. I have built one python file which converts whatever you give command to speech (Voice To Text) and give input to java file. In java file, there is a watcher which runs the entire java code if any file is created using python and runs the program.

Step-1: Run java script on backend.
Step-2: Make sure your folder has no file named "input.txt"
Step-3: Run python script.
Step-4: Give command according to python script asks about.
Step-5: And the automation will start.

I have accomplished this task around amazon web service only. So whatever item you want to add in your cart, amazon will add it into your cart.
